I am a student and I am really interested in Machine Learning related fields. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
I have taken loans for my college degree and take part-time tuitions to earn and pay my daily expenses. I was born poor but I am making sure I don't die poor as I hear in a lot of motivational speeches. Coursera is taking a great initiative to help genuinely interested people who can't afford online classes due to financial problems. I am trying to gain all the skills I can and follow my passion. My parents are poor and are not able to provide for my college degree or my living expense but I convinced them to let me study because that's what I want to do. I want to research in the amazing field of Machine Learning and do something amazing for the world. I pay my college fees through loans and live by my tuition earning which is around Rs. 6500 ($100 approximately) per month. I also try to save some money and send home to support my family in all the way I can. The college provides me free wifi and so I make full use of the internet to gain relevant skills. I am paying EMIs for my laptop and my phone.
I want to learn about Deep Learning intrigued by its multifarious applications. I know that the future is going to be awesome and I want to have a part in creating that. I don't want to be left behind just because of the lack of money. This financial aid will help me gain relevant knowledge and gain a certificate to advance my career.
